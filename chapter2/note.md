# Python Sequence Type by Data Type:
1. container sequences: list, tuple, collecitons.deque -> any type of data
2. flat sequences: str, bytes, bytearray, memoryview, array.array -> only primitive values like char, bytres, and numbers

# Python Sequence Type by Mutability:
1. Mutable Sequences: list, bytearray, arra.arra, collections.deque, memoryview
2. Immutable Sequences: tuple, str, bytes

# Note
List Comprehension: Listcomp Generator Expression: Genexp
1. Genexp saves memory because it yields items one by one using the iterator protocol instead of builiding a whle list just to feed another constructor. -> use genexp to initialize s equences other than lists, or to produce output that you don't need to keep in memory
2.
